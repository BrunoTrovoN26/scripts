# Scripts

This will host the scripts that find useful for my android development setup.

## install-env

This script will try to install the following dependencies on your environment:
- Homebrew
- wget
- Android Studio
- Java 8
- Google Chrome
- ktlint
- git

- Slack (optional)
- Source Tree (optional)
- iTerm2 (optional)
- oh-my-zsh (optional)

In addition it will try to setup a correct git configuration by asking your name and email, and create a private SSH key so that you don't have to authenticate everytime.
